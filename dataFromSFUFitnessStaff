There are 6 fundamental movements of a good workout:
•	Squatting motion
•	Hip hinge/deadlift motion
•	Horizontal press
•	Horizontal pull
•	Vertical press
•	Vertical pull

The recommended number of movements(exercises)
•	Beginners
o	3 to 5 movements for a session ~ 1 hour
•	Advanced
o	4 to 6 movements for a session ~ 1 hour

Sets and Repetitions:
•	Beginners
o	2 sets for 10-15 repetitions
	The last 3 to 4 repetitions should be near failure (total muscle exertion)
•	Advanced (focuses on more stability and balance)
o	Strength training:
	3 to 6 sets for 3-10 repetitions
o	Muscle gain:
	2 to 8 sets for 5-15 repetitions
•	The last 2 repetitions should be near failure

In between sets, the person should rest around 1-2 minutes. 
Beginners should focus on perfecting form using their body weight, then slowly add more weight as they progress over time.
Advanced people should still be doing beginner exercises. The beginner exercises listed are more focused for beginners but are still great exercises. 
Warmups:
•	Do the movements slower with less weight to no weight at all. 
o	Do 5 to 10 repetitions
•	Consider only using body weight. 
Cool down:
•	Dynamic stretching to prevent any soreness.
•	Do 5-10 minutes of stretching for each part of your body
o	(should include a section for cool down)
•	10 to 30 seconds for each muscle range
•	1 to 3 sets for each stretch
Squatting movements:
Beginner:
•	Squat rack
•	Leg press
o	Different leg positioning targets different muscle groups
•	Smith squat (using a smith machine)
•	Goblet squat
Advanced:
•	Barbell squats
•	Split squats
•	Lunges
o	Focus is for single leg/balance/stability
Hip Hinge/Deadlift movements:
Beginner (easier to do these movements using machines)
•	45 degree hyper extension bench (like those bench press ones)
o	Do the hyper extension on the bench
	It will be more stable than deadlift
o	Start with body weight
•	Reverse hyper extension machine
o	Start with 10lbs
•	Back extension machine
o	Start with 10lbs

Advanced:
•	Barbell/dumbbell deadlift
•	Good morning exercises (bar bell is on the back)

Advanced should also be doing the beginner focused exercises. 

Horizontal press:
Beginner:
•	Bench press/chess press (use machine)
o	Start out with benching the bar 
o	For machines, start with 10lbs. 
Advanced:
•	Bar bell and dumbbell
o	Dumbbell press, start with 10lbs



Horizontal pull:
Beginner:
•	Row machine
o	Start with 5lbs
•	Push ups
o	There are many variations. 
o	Start with inclined then work your way to doing it on the ground. 
o	Start against the wall, then 45 degrees, 1 foot above ground, and then ground?

Advanced:
•	Bar bell rows
o	Start out with the weight of the bar
•	Dumbbell row
o	Have both weights in your hands and use the other one for stabilization
	Start with 5lbs

Vertical press:
Beginner:
•	Shoulder press (machine)
o	Start in the 2 to 10 lbs range
•	Pike push up
o	A push up position but your hands are over your head and not underneath your chest.
Advanced:
•	Dumb bell/bar bell (over head)
o	Start with just the weight of the bar
o	Dumbbells start with ~3lbs

Vertical pull:
•	Lat pull down (machine)
o	Start with 15lbs
•	Assisted pull ups
o	Variation 1 - machine
	The heavier the weight, the easier it will be to do the pullup. 
	Start with a weight that is 20% less than your body weight. 
	Decrease the weight when can comfortably do 5 to 10 repetitions
o	Variation 2 – resistance bands
	Use a thick resistance band ~2 inches to aid you with doing the pull ups. 
	The thicker the band the easier it is.
	Progress by using thinner bands. 
o	Variation 3 – negatives
	Instead of a pulling up and down movement, you start with the already pulled up movement where your chin is above the bar. 
	Slowly lower your body down.
